# Homework Assignment 

## assignment
[[AI6103_Assignment___MobileNet (1).pdf]]
- “we will investigate the effects of hyperparameters such as initial learning rate, learning rate schedule, weight decay, and data augmentation on deep neural networks” 
- “First, you should use the **MobileNet** network and the **CIFAR-100** dataset. You should use the SGD optimization algorithm with **momentum set to 0.9.** You should not use other optimization algorithms like Adam or Adagrad. The MobileNet code has been provided on NTULearn, which you need to modify for this assignment.”

## to-do

### Data Preprocessing (10%)
we need to preprosses the data
### Learning Rate (20%)
implement different learning rates 
### Learning Rate Schedule (20%)
Adjust the learning rate according to cosine annealing
### Weight Decay (20%)
Learn about **weight decay** and **L2 regularization**. Play around with different weight decay coefficients . (you don't actually have to do any L2 regularization)
### Data Augmentation (30%)
play around with flips (**horizontal flip**, **random cropping** and **mixup**) and describe their effect.

## grading
This assignment will be graded using the following criteria: 
- You can perform the experiments correctly, as demonstrated in the results. 
- You can plot the experimental results correctly and in an easy-to-understand manner.
- You can describe the results of the experiments accurately and concisely. 
- You can analyze and explain the results, and correctly relate the results to content discussed in the lectures. Note that enumerating everything in the lectures indiscriminately will result in point deduction. 
- You can write a report that demonstrates correct usage of English. You can communicate clearly, concisely, and unambiguously within the page limit. 
## hand in format 
The report should be in the double-column AAAI format, for which the author kit can be downloaded from https://aaai.org/authorkit24-2/. The LATEX format is preferred to the Word format, though the latter is allowed. The report should contain six pages or less, excluding references. Exceeding the page limit will automatically result in deduction of 20 points. Modifying the report format to avoid exceeding the page limit will result in deduction of 20 points.
